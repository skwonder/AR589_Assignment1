        <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
          <b>Rock climbing</b> is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling.
          Due to the length and extended endurance required and because accidents are more likely to happen on the descent than the ascent, rock climbers do not usually climb back down the route. It is very rare for a climber to down climb, especially
          on the larger multiple pitches (class III- IV and /or multi-day grades IV-VI climbs). Professional rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on
          an increasingly difficult route. Scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, is similar to rock climbing. However, rock climbing is generally differentiated by its sustained use of hands to support the
          climber's weight as well as to provide balance. </p>
        <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
          Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. It can be a dangerous activity and knowledge of proper climbing techniques and use of specialized
          climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes. Because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines.</p>

        <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
          <b>Indoor climbing</b> occurs in buildings on artificial rock structures. This permits for climbing in all types of weather and at all times of the day. Climbers climb indoors to improve their skills and techniques, as well as for general exercise
          or fun. Indoor climbing gyms typically provide rope setups and ensure that new climbers know safe techniques.</p>
        <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
          <b>Outdoors</b>, climbs usually take place on sunny days when the holds are dry and provide the best grip, but climbers can also attempt to climb at night or in adverse weather conditions if they have the proper training and equipment. However,
          night climbing or climbing in adverse weather conditions will increase the difficulty and danger on any climbing route.</p>

      <h1 class="yellow f5 f3-ns ttu tc">History</h1>
      <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
        Paintings dating from 200 BC show Chinese men rock climbing. In early America, the cliff-dwelling Anasazi in the 12th century were thought to be excellent climbers. Early European climbers used rock climbing techniques as a skill required to reach the
        summit in their mountaineering exploits. In the 1880s, European rock climbing became an independent pursuit outside of mountain climbing.</p>
      <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
        Although rock climbing was an important component of Victorian mountaineering in the Alps, it is generally thought that the sport of rock climbing began in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in various parts of Europe. Rock climbing evolved gradually
        from an alpine necessity to a distinct athletic activity.</p>
      <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
        Aid climbing, climbing using equipment that acts as artificial handhold or footholds, became popular during the period 1920-1960, leading to ascents in the Alps and in Yosemite Valley that were considered impossible without such means. However, climbing
        techniques, equipment and ethical considerations have evolved steadily. Today, free climbing, climbing using holds made entirely of natural rock while using gear solely for protection and not for upward movement, is the most popular form of the
        sport. Free climbing has since been divided into several sub-styles of climbing dependent on belay configuration.</p>
      <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
        Over time, grading systems have also been created in order to compare more accurately the relative difficulties of the rock climbs.</p>

        <p class="navy f7 f5-ns">
          In How to Rock Climb, John Long notes that for moderately skilled climbers simply getting to the top of a route is not enough; how one gets to the top matters. In rock climbing, style refers to the method of ascending the cliff. There are three main styles
          of climbing: on-sight, flash, and redpoint. To on-sight a route is to ascend the wall without aid or any foreknowledge. It is considered the way to climb with the most style. Flashing is similar to on-sighting, except that the climber has previous
          information about the route including talking about the beta with other climbers. Redpointing means to make a free ascent of the route after having first tried it. Style is mostly up to each individual climber and even among climbers the verbiage
          and definitions can differ.</p>

        <h1 class="yellow f5 f3-ns ttu tc">  Injuries</h1>
        <p class="navy f7 f5-ns"> Injuries in rock climbing are mainly sport injuries that occur due to falls or overuse. Injuries due to falls are relatively uncommon; the vast majority of injuries result from overuse, most often occurring in the fingers, elbows, and shoulders.</p>
        <p class="navy f7 f5-ns"> Such injuries are often no worse than torn calluses, cuts, burns and bruises. There are a number of skincare products specifically for climbers available in the market. However, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage especially
          to tendons, tendon sheaths, ligaments, and capsules. Injuries from lead climbing are common.</p>
